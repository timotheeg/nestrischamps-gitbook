Use [Admin Panel](https://nestrischamps.io/room/admin) to administer a room.

In the Admin Panel, you get to see who is connected to the room, and select the desired producers as player 1 and player 2.

The Name and Avatar are taken from Twitch data, but can be updated to suit.

The number of match to get to victory can change (`Best of` dropdown).

Each player has a heart control, the heart can be clicked to attribute victories.

The `Winner` button displays a little animation in the field to show the winner and loser of the match. Do NOT click it until both players have topped out! If the winning player is chasing a maxout or what not, wait till he/she is done before clicking.

Finally the `Clear Victories` button resets the victory for both players to 0, and stops the winner animation.
